# DevOps Projects

This repository contains hands-on DevOps projects created to learn, practice, and demonstrate core DevOps concepts through real, practical implementations.

Each project focuses on a specific area of DevOps such as Linux, scripting, cloud, monitoring, automation, infrastructure as code, and system troubleshooting.
The goal is simple: **learn by building**, not by memorizing tools.

---

## Objectives

* Build a strong foundation in DevOps fundamentals
* Gain hands-on experience with real-world scenarios
* Understand how systems behave in production environments
* Create a portfolio of practical projects that reflect real DevOps work
* Continuously improve through iteration and optimization

---

## Repository Structure

Each project lives in its own directory and includes:

* Source code or scripts
* A dedicated README explaining:

  * Problem statement
  * Tools and technologies used
  * How to run the project
  * Key learnings

Example structure:

## Topics Covered (and growing)

* Linux system administration
* Shell scripting (Bash)
* Process and resource monitoring

This list will expand as new projects are added.

---

## Projects Included

### 1. Server Performance Monitoring Script

* Bash script to analyze CPU, memory, disk usage, and running processes
* Uses native Linux utilities only
* Focuses on understanding system internals and performance metrics

More projects will be added incrementally.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* Linux
* Bash
* Git & GitHub
* Monitoring and system utilities

---

## Why This Repository Exists

DevOps is not about knowing tools.
It’s about understanding systems, automation, and failure modes.

This repository is a personal learning space and a public demonstration of:

* Problem-solving approach
* Practical Linux and cloud knowledge
* Ability to build and explain real DevOps solutions
